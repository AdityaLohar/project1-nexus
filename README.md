# project1-nexus
1. This project provides a well-designed and functional login/register page with responsive elements. The combination of Bootstrap, custom styles, and dynamic JavaScript functionality contributes to a user-friendly experience.
2. The use of animations adds a touch to the overall design.
3. It was mentioned in the assignment to use gradient in the background. But after applying a gradient bg, i was not getting any matching colour for the form so i thought lets make it transparent.
4. Then i was not satisfied with the static gradient background after trying a few colour combos.
5. So i thought of giving it a changing background using animation.
6. Not any difficulty faced as such.
